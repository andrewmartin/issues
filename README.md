# Github Issues

This is an example project that showcases React/Redux to sort Github issues.

Goals of the application:

1. Provide interface to login with `apiKey`
2. Fetch repositories of current user
3. See issues related to each repository
4. Set a custom order of issues (and fallback to default order)
